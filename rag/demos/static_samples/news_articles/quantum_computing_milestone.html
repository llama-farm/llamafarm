            <p class="lead">IBM has achieved a major milestone in quantum computing with the successful demonstration of a 1000-qubit quantum processor, marking the first time a quantum computer has reached this scale while maintaining the coherence necessary for practical applications. The breakthrough promises to accelerate solutions to complex problems in cryptography, optimization, and scientific simulation.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content">
            <h2>Breaking the 1000-Qubit Barrier</h2>
            <p>The new quantum processor, dubbed "Quantum Condor," represents a significant leap from IBM's previous 433-qubit Osprey processor. What makes this achievement particularly remarkable is not just the scale, but the system's ability to maintain quantum coherence across all 1000 qubits simultaneously—a technical challenge that has eluded researchers for years.</p>

            <p>"This isn't just about reaching an arbitrary number," explained Dr. Sarah Johnson, IBM's Director of Quantum Computing Research. "We've demonstrated sustained quantum advantage on real-world problems that would take classical computers millions of years to solve."</p>

            <h2>Technical Breakthrough: Error Correction at Scale</h2>
            <p>The key to IBM's success lies in revolutionary advances in quantum error correction and qubit connectivity. The Quantum Condor employs a novel "hexagonal lattice" architecture that dramatically reduces error rates while maintaining high connectivity between qubits.</p>

            <div class="technical-specs">
                <h3>Quantum Condor Specifications</h3>
                <ul>

            </div>

            <h2>Demonstrated Quantum Advantage</h2>
            <p>IBM's research team has successfully demonstrated quantum advantage in several practical applications:</p>

            <h3>Cryptographic Security Analysis</h3>
            <p>The system successfully factored a 2048-bit RSA key in under 8 hours—a task that would require a classical supercomputer several decades to complete. This demonstration has immediate implications for cybersecurity and the development of quantum-resistant encryption methods.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "This result fundamentally changes the timeline for when we need quantum-resistant cryptography. Organizations need to start planning their transition now, not in 10-15 years as previously thought."
                <cite>— Dr. Alex Chen, Cybersecurity Research Institute</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Drug Discovery Acceleration</h3>
            <p>In collaboration with pharmaceutical giant Roche, IBM demonstrated the system's ability to simulate molecular interactions for a promising Alzheimer's drug candidate. The quantum simulation identified potential binding sites and side effects in 3 days—a process that typically requires 6-12 months using classical computational methods.</p>

            <h3>Financial Portfolio Optimization</h3>
            <p>Working with JPMorgan Chase, the team solved a complex portfolio optimization problem involving 10,000 assets and hundreds of constraints. The quantum solution found optimal allocations 1000x faster than classical methods while exploring a significantly larger solution space.</p>

            <h2>Industry Impact and Market Response</h2>
