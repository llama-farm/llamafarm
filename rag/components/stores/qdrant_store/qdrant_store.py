"""Qdrant Vector Store Component - Coming Soon

This vector store will provide integration with Qdrant, a high-performance
vector similarity search engine built with Rust.

Planned Features:
- Full Qdrant API integration (local and cloud)
- Advanced filtering and metadata support
- Quantization and compression options
- Distributed and replicated collections
- High-performance search with HNSW indexing
- Multi-tenant support

Status: Implementation in progress

# Future implementation notes:
# 1. Will use qdrant-client Python library
# 2. Support for both local and cloud Qdrant instances
# 3. Advanced features:
#    - Payload filtering with complex conditions
#    - Vector quantization for memory efficiency
#    - Distributed collections with sharding
#    - Real-time updates and deletions
# 4. Optimization features:
#    - Bulk operations for large datasets
#    - Connection pooling and retry logic
#    - Memory-mapped storage options
