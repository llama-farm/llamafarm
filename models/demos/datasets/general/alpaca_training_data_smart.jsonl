Depot-level Maintenance: Provides the capability to maintain materiel coded for\norganizational, intermediate and depot levels of maintenance. Includes maintenance\nrequiring the overhaul, upgrading, or rebuilding of parts, assemblies, or subassemblies, and\nthe testing and reclamation of equipment as necessary.\n1.3.2. Organizational and intermediate-level maintenance is organized into two mutually\nexclusive networks, the Mission Generation Network (MGN) and the Repair Network (RN).\nThe MGN is optimized for mission generation at the wing level and consists of authorized “onequipment” and “off-equipment” maintenance capabilities required to launch, recover,\nconfigure, inspect, and repair AF systems and equipment. The RN supports the MGN by\nproviding the maintenance required to fulfill operational needs outside the capability or\ncapacity of MGN activities. The interface between the two networks takes place when the\nMGN activity relinquishes control of reparable assets to the RN activity (such as, supply\ncounter turn-in) or changes an end item Purpose Identifier Code (PIC) from an operational\nactivity to a repair network activity (such as, depot maintenance).\n1.3.2.1. Most MGN units possess a complement of equipment and supplies necessary to\nperform on-equipment and off-equipment maintenance.\n1.3.2.2. RN units may reside at bases that perform mission generation. RN requirements\nand processes are identified in DAFI 20-117, Repair Network Management.", "output": "- 2020"}
