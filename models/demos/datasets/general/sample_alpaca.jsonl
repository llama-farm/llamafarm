{"instruction": "What is machine learning?", "input": "", "output": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that can automatically learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions."}
{"instruction": "Explain neural networks", "input": "", "output": "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers that process and transmit information. Each connection has a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds, enabling the network to recognize patterns and make predictions."}
{"instruction": "What is deep learning?", "input": "", "output": "Deep learning is a machine learning technique that uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence 'deep') to model and understand complex patterns in data. It's particularly effective for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition."}
