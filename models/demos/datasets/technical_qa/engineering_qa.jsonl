{"instruction": "What is the difference between SQL joins and when to use each type?", "input": "", "output": "SQL joins combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns, with different join types returning different result sets.\n\n**Sample tables for examples:**\n```sql\n-- Users table\nusers:\nuser_id | name     | email\n1       | Alice    | alice@email.com\n2       | Bob      | bob@email.com\n3       | Charlie  | charlie@email.com\n\n-- Orders table\norders:\norder_id | user_id | product   | amount\n101      | 1       | Laptop    | 1000\n102      | 1       | Mouse     | 25\n103      | 2       | Keyboard  | 75\n104      | 5       | Monitor   | 300\n```\n\n**Join types:**\n\n**1. INNER JOIN**\nReturns only rows that have matching values in both tables\n\n```sql\nSELECT u.name, o.product, o.amount\nFROM users u\nINNER JOIN orders o ON u.user_id = o.user_id;\n```\n\n**Result:**\n```\nname    | product  | amount\nAlice   | Laptop   | 1000\nAlice   | Mouse    | 25\nBob     | Keyboard | 75\n```\n\n**When to use:** Most common join type. Use when you only want records that exist in both tables.\n\n**2. LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)**\nReturns all rows from left table, matched rows from right table, NULL for non-matches\n\n```sql\nSELECT u.name, o.product, o.amount\nFROM users u\nLEFT JOIN orders o ON u.user_id = o.user_id;\n```\n\n**Result:**\n```\nname    | product  | amount\nAlice   | Laptop   | 1000\nAlice   | Mouse    | 25\nBob     | Keyboard | 75\nCharlie | NULL     | NULL\n```\n\n**When to use:** Find all records from primary table, whether or not they have related records. Example: All customers and their orders (including customers with no orders).\n\n**3. RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**\nReturns all rows from right table, matched rows from left table, NULL for non-matches\n\n```sql\nSELECT u.name, o.product, o.amount\nFROM users u\nRIGHT JOIN orders o ON u.user_id = o.user_id;\n```\n\n**Result:**\n```\nname    | product  | amount\nAlice   | Laptop   | 1000\nAlice   | Mouse    | 25\nBob     | Keyboard | 75\nNULL    | Monitor  | 300\n```\n\n**When to use:** Less common. Use when you want all records from the second table. Example: All orders, even those without valid user records (orphaned orders).\n\n**4. FULL OUTER JOIN**\nReturns all rows when there's a match in either table, NULL for non-matches\n\n```sql\nSELECT u.name, o.product, o.amount\nFROM users u\nFULL OUTER JOIN orders o ON u.user_id = o.user_id;\n```\n\n**Result:**\n```\nname    | product  | amount\nAlice   | Laptop   | 1000\nAlice   | Mouse    | 25\nBob     | Keyboard | 75\nCharlie | NULL     | NULL\nNULL    | Monitor  | 300\n```\n\n**When to use:** When you want all records from both tables. Example: Complete picture of all users and all orders, highlighting gaps in data.\n\n**5. CROSS JOIN**\nReturns Cartesian product - every row from first table joined with every row from second table\n\n```sql\nSELECT u.name, o.product\nFROM users u\nCROSS JOIN orders o;\n```\n\n**Result:** 3 users × 4 orders = 12 rows\n```\nname    | product\nAlice   | Laptop\nAlice   | Mouse\nAlice   | Keyboard\nAlice   | Monitor\nBob     | Laptop\n... (12 total rows)\n```\n\n**When to use:** Rarely used. Useful for generating combinations or test data. Example: All possible product-category combinations.\n\n**Self JOIN**\nJoin table with itself to find relationships within the same table\n\n```sql\n-- Find users in same city\nSELECT u1.name as user1, u2.name as user2, u1.city\nFROM users u1\nINNER JOIN users u2 ON u1.city = u2.city AND u1.user_id < u2.user_id;\n```\n\n**Advanced join concepts:**\n\n**Multiple joins:**\n```sql\nSELECT u.name, o.product, od.quantity, p.price\nFROM users u\nINNER JOIN orders o ON u.user_id = o.user_id\nINNER JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id\nINNER JOIN products p ON od.product_id = p.product_id;\n```\n\n**Join conditions beyond equality:**\n```sql\n-- Find orders placed within 30 days of user registration\nSELECT u.name, o.order_date\nFROM users u\nINNER JOIN orders o ON u.user_id = o.user_id \n    AND o.order_date BETWEEN u.registration_date \n    AND u.registration_date + INTERVAL 30 DAY;\n```\n\n**Performance considerations:**\n\n**Indexing:**\n- Create indexes on join columns\n- Primary keys automatically indexed\n- Foreign keys should be indexed\n\n**Join order matters:**\n- Start with most selective table (fewest rows)\n- Database optimizer usually handles this\n- Use EXPLAIN to analyze query execution plan\n\n**Subqueries vs. joins:**\n```sql\n-- Subquery approach\nSELECT name FROM users \nWHERE user_id IN (SELECT user_id FROM orders);\n\n-- Join approach (usually faster)\nSELECT DISTINCT u.name \nFROM users u\nINNER JOIN orders o ON u.user_id = o.user_id;\n```\n\n**Common use cases:**\n\n**Business reporting:**\n- Customer order history (LEFT JOIN)\n- Product sales analysis (INNER JOIN)\n- Missing data identification (OUTER JOINs)\n\n**Data validation:**\n- Find orphaned records (RIGHT JOIN with NULL check)\n- Data integrity checks (FULL OUTER JOIN)\n- Duplicate detection (SELF JOIN)\n\n**Best practices:**\n- Always specify join conditions explicitly\n- Use table aliases for readability\n- Consider performance implications of join types\n- Use appropriate join type based on business requirements\n- Test with representative data volumes"}
