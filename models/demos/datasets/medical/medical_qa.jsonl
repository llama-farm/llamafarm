{"instruction": "What is the difference between a heart attack and cardiac arrest?", "input": "", "output": "A heart attack occurs when blood flow to part of the heart is blocked, usually by a clot in a coronary artery. The person remains conscious and breathing. Cardiac arrest is when the heart stops beating effectively, causing the person to become unconscious and stop breathing normally. Cardiac arrest can result from a heart attack but has other causes too. **Emergency Response**: Both are medical emergencies. For heart attack, call 911 and consider chewing aspirin if not allergic. For cardiac arrest, call 911 and immediately begin CPR if trained. Quick response is critical for both conditions."}
{"instruction": "What are normal blood pressure readings?", "input": "", "output": "Normal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mmHg. Elevated is 120-129 systolic and less than 80 diastolic.
