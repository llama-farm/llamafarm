## Business Problem

During the FDA approval process, companies must:

- Track regulatory questions across multiple document types (Complete Response Letters, Information Requests, Meeting Minutes)
- Ensure all FDA questions have been adequately answered
- Validate answers against historical correspondence (COFUS database)
- Maintain confidence levels for answer authenticity
- Avoid missing critical unanswered questions that could delay approval

Manual review is time-consuming, error-prone, and doesn't scale as document volumes increase.

## Solution Architecture

LlamaFarm's agent-based approach automates this workflow:

```
FDA Documents → Vector Database → Agent Analysis → Question Extraction →
Answer Validation → Confidence Scoring → Summary Report
```

### Key Components

1. **RAG-Enabled Document Store**: All FDA correspondence ingested into vector database
2. **Document Analysis Agent**: Recursively processes chunks to extract questions
3. **Answer Validation Agent**: Cross-references extracted questions against COFUS database
4. **Batch Orchestrator**: Manages processing of large document sets
5. **Confidence Scoring**: Provides reliability metrics for each answer

## Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

### Prerequisites

- LlamaFarm installed and configured
- FDA documents in supported formats (PDF, Word, etc.)
- Access to COFUS or equivalent answer database

### Step 1: Ingest FDA Documents into Vector Database

[Watch: Document Ingestion (0:27)](https://loom.com/share/19b0f86d7e074025b12ca675c2257f25?t=27)

Create a dataset and ingest all FDA correspondence:

```bash
# Create dataset for FDA documents
lf datasets add fda_correspondence -s universal_processor -b fda_db

# Ingest documents (supports glob patterns)
lf datasets ingest fda_correspondence ./fda_documents/*.pdf

# Process into vector database
lf datasets process fda_correspondence
```

**Best Practice**: Organize documents by submission cycle (e.g., `cycle_1/`, `cycle_2/`) for easier tracking.

### Step 2: Start Recursive Script for Document Analysis

[Watch: Agent Processing (0:38)](https://loom.com/share/19b0f86d7e074025b12ca675c2257f25?t=38)

Configure and run the FDA document analyzer agent:

```bash
# Run the FDA document analyzer
lf agents run fda_document_analyzer --input-file ./config/fda_input.json
```

The agent will:
- Break documents into manageable chunks
- Process each chunk independently
- Track progress across the entire corpus

**Configuration Example** (`fda_input.json`):

```json
{
  "database": "fda_db",
  "document_types": ["complete_response", "information_request", "meeting_minutes"],
  "chunk_size": 4000,
  "chunk_overlap": 200
}
```

### Step 3: Extract Questions from Documents

[Watch: Question Extraction (0:48)](https://loom.com/share/19b0f86d7e074025b12ca675c2257f25?t=48)

The agent sends document chunks to the LLM with specialized prompts to identify regulatory questions:

**System Prompt Example**:
```
You are analyzing FDA correspondence. Extract all regulatory questions
from the provided text. Focus on substantive questions about:
- Clinical data requirements
- Safety/efficacy concerns
- Manufacturing/quality controls
- Labeling requirements

Exclude administrative questions (meeting scheduling, contact info, etc.)

Return questions in this format:
{
  "question": "...",
  "category": "clinical|safety|manufacturing|labeling",
  "document_section": "..."
}
```

### Step 4: Validate Answers Against COFUS Database

[Watch: Answer Validation (1:05)](https://loom.com/share/19b0f86d7e074025b12ca675c2257f25?t=65)

For each extracted question, the agent:

1. Queries the COFUS database using RAG
2. Retrieves relevant passages
3. Validates if the question has been adequately answered
4. Assesses answer authenticity

```bash
# Query specific question against COFUS
lf rag query --database cofus_db \
  --score-threshold 0.7 \
  "Has clinical endpoint XYZ been addressed?"
```

### Step 5: Save Results and Confidence Scores

[Watch: Results & Scoring (1:22)](https://loom.com/share/19b0f86d7e074025b12ca675c2257f25?t=82)

The agent generates structured output with confidence metrics:

```json
{
  "question_id": "Q_001",
  "question": "What additional clinical data is required for endpoint validation?",
  "status": "answered",
  "confidence_score": 0.95,
  "answer_source": "COFUS Letter 2024-03-15",
  "answer_summary": "Two additional Phase 3 studies required...",
  "validation_method": "semantic_match"
}
```

**Confidence Threshold**: Focus on scores ≥ 90% for reliable answers. Questions with lower scores may require manual review.

### Step 6: Review Summary of Findings

[Watch: Summary Report (1:43)](https://loom.com/share/19b0f86d7e074025b12ca675c2257f25?t=103)

Generate an executive summary report:

```bash
lf agents run fda_summary_generator --input-file ./results/analysis_results.json
```

**Sample Summary Output**:

```
FDA Document Analysis Summary
=============================
Total Questions Identified: 47
Answered Questions: 42 (89%)
Unanswered Questions: 5 (11%)
Average Confidence Score: 0.93

High Priority Unanswered Questions:
1. [Clinical] What is the required duration for long-term safety follow-up?
2. [Manufacturing] Has the API impurity profile been fully characterized?
3. [Labeling] Are pediatric use restrictions required in Section 8?

Next Actions:
- Review 3 low-confidence answers (0.70-0.85 range)
- Prepare responses for 5 unanswered questions
- Submit supplemental information package
```

### Step 7: Utilize Batch Orchestrator for Processing

[Watch: Batch Processing (2:19)](https://loom.com/share/19b0f86d7e074025b12ca675c2257f25?t=139)

For large document sets, use the batch orchestrator:

```bash
# Process multiple documents in parallel
lf agents run batch_orchestrator \
  --agent fda_document_analyzer \
  --input-dir ./fda_documents/ \
  --concurrency 5 \
  --output-dir ./results/
```

**Monitoring**:
```bash
# Check processing status
lf agents status batch_orchestrator

# View logs
lf agents logs batch_orchestrator --tail 100
```

### Step 8: Adjust Agents and System Prompts as Needed

[Watch: Agent Customization (4:14)](https://loom.com/share/19b0f86d7e074025b12ca675c2257f25?t=254)

Customize agents based on your specific regulatory focus:

**Example: Prioritize Safety Questions**

Edit `llamafarm.yaml`:

```yaml
agents:
  fda_document_analyzer:
    system_prompt: |
      You are analyzing FDA correspondence with EXTRA FOCUS on safety concerns.
      Prioritize questions related to:
      - Adverse events
      - Safety signal monitoring
      - Risk mitigation strategies

      Mark safety questions with HIGH priority.

    parameters:
      temperature: 0.2  # Lower for consistency
      top_k: 5
      score_threshold: 0.85
```

Test configurations on a subset before scaling:

```bash
# Test on 10 documents first
lf agents run fda_document_analyzer \
  --input-file ./test_config.json \
  --limit 10 \
  --dry-run
```

## Cautionary Notes

⚠️ **Document Formatting**: Ensure documents are properly formatted before ingestion. Scanned PDFs may require OCR preprocessing.

⚠️ **Process Interruption**: The recursive process saves checkpoints. If stopped, it can resume from the last checkpoint, but plan for uninterrupted runs of 2-4 hours for large document sets.

⚠️ **Confidence Thresholds**: Don't rely solely on high-confidence scores. Critical questions should undergo manual review regardless of score.

⚠️ **Model Selection**: Use more powerful models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) for regulatory analysis. Smaller models may miss nuanced questions.

## Tips for Efficiency

💡 **Overnight Processing**: Start the analysis at the end of the workday and let agents run independently for several hours. Review results the next morning.

💡 **Staged Rollout**: Test on a subset (10-20 documents) first to validate prompts and configuration before processing the full corpus.

💡 **Model Switching**: Use fast models for initial question extraction, then switch to powerful models for answer validation:

```bash
# Fast model for extraction
lf chat --model fast --agent question_extractor

# Powerful model for validation
lf chat --model powerful --agent answer_validator
```

💡 **Incremental Processing**: Process documents as they arrive rather than batch-processing at the end:

```bash
# Add to existing dataset
lf datasets ingest fda_correspondence ./new_documents/*.pdf
lf datasets process fda_correspondence --incremental
```
