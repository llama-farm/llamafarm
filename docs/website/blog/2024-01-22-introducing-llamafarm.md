# Introducing LlamaFarm: Config-Based AI for Everyone

Today, we're excited to announce LlamaFarm - an open-source framework that makes deploying AI as simple as writing a YAML file. Run any model, anywhere, with just configuration.

<!--truncate-->

## The Vision

Remember when deploying a web app meant manually configuring servers, installing dependencies, and writing deployment scripts? Then came tools like Docker and Kubernetes that changed everything with declarative configuration.

We're bringing that same revolution to AI.

## What is LlamaFarm?

LlamaFarm is a configuration-based AI deployment framework that lets you:

- üè† **Run models locally** on your hardware
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Deploy to any cloud** (AWS, Azure, GCP, or your own)
- üîÑ **Switch models instantly** with config changes
- üõ°Ô∏è **Keep data private** with local-first processing
- üìä **Scale seamlessly** from laptop to cluster

## Simple as YAML

Here's all it takes to deploy a multi-model AI pipeline:

```yaml
# llamafarm.yaml
models:
  - name: local-llama
    type: llama2-7b
    device: cuda
    
  - name: embeddings
    type: sentence-transformers
    model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
    
pipeline:
  - embed: 
      model: embeddings
      input: documents
  - generate:
      model: local-llama
      prompt: "Summarize: {context}"
      
deploy:
  local: true
  replicas: 2
```

Run it with:
```bash
llamafarm up
```

That's it. LlamaFarm handles model downloading, optimization, serving, and scaling.

## Real-World Use Cases

### Secure Document Processing
```yaml
models:
  - name: doc-analyzer
    type: llama2-13b
    quantization: int8
    
pipeline:
  - extract: 
      type: pdf
      path: /secure/documents
  - analyze:
      model: doc-analyzer
      keep_local: true  # Never send to cloud
```

### Multi-Cloud Deployment
```yaml
deploy:
  targets:
    - aws:
        region: us-east-1
        instance: g4dn.xlarge
    - azure:
        region: westus2
        sku: Standard_NC6s_v3
    - local:
        when: development
```

### Edge AI
```yaml
models:
  - name: edge-vision
    type: mobilenet
    optimize: edge
    
deploy:
  edge:
    devices: 
      - raspberry-pi-cluster
      - nvidia-jetson
    sync: true
```

## Getting Started

1. **Install LlamaFarm:**
```bash
pip install llamafarm
# or
brew install llamafarm
```

2. **Create your config:**
```bash
llamafarm init my-ai-app
cd my-ai-app
```

3. **Deploy:**
```bash
llamafarm up
```

4. **Use your AI:**
```bash
curl localhost:8080/generate \
  -d '{"prompt": "Hello, LlamaFarm!"}'
```

## Open Source & Community Driven

LlamaFarm is 100% open source under the Apache 2.0 license. We believe AI infrastructure should be:

- **Transparent** - See exactly how your AI runs
- **Extensible** - Add your own models and deployments
- **Community-owned** - No vendor lock-in

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning. Our roadmap includes:

- üîå **Plugin system** for custom processors
- üéØ **Fine-tuning workflows** built-in
- üì± **Mobile SDKs** for iOS/Android
- üåê **Distributed training** support
- ü§ñ **AutoML capabilities**
