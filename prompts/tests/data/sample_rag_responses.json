In diagnostics, ML models analyze medical imaging with remarkable precision, often matching or surpassing human radiologists in detecting conditions like diabetic retinopathy and skin cancer. For personalized medicine, ML algorithms process vast amounts of patient data including genetics, medical history, and treatment responses to recommend tailored therapies, particularly effective in oncology. Predictive analytics represents another crucial application, where ML systems forecast patient deterioration, readmission risks, and treatment outcomes, enabling proactive interventions that have demonstrably reduced ICU mortality rates by up to 15%. These advances collectively enhance diagnostic accuracy, optimize treatment selection, and improve patient safety while reducing healthcare costs.",
