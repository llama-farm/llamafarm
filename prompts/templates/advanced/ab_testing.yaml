    input:
      test_description: Testing chain-of-thought vs direct answer prompts for math
        problems
      variant_a_name: Chain of Thought
      variant_a_config: Prompts include step-by-step reasoning instructions
      variant_a_responses: 'Response 1: Shows detailed work, correct answer

        Response 2: Clear steps, correct answer

        Response 3: Verbose but accurate'
      variant_b_name: Direct Answer
      variant_b_config: Prompts ask for immediate answers without showing work
      variant_b_responses: 'Response 1: Quick answer, correct

        Response 2: Fast response, minor error

        Response 3: Concise, correct'
      evaluation_metrics: Accuracy, response time, user preference for explanation
        detail
    expected_output: '**Winner**: Chain of Thought

      **Key Finding**: Higher accuracy (95% vs 87%) despite longer response time

      **Recommendation**: Use Chain of Thought for complex problems, Direct Answer
      for simple queries'
